<h1>TodoList Project From Launch Schools RB130 Ruby Foundations Course</h1>
<p>
  This project was a very simple dive into working with classes and objects, creating a Command-Line Based Todo-List.
  Each element within the list contains a state, represented by an instance variable: done or not done.
  Based on each item's state, the display is generated accordingly.
